# Tic-Tac-Toe Online

Practical assignment for the subject Computer networking at UFMG.
This work implements the classical Tic-Tac-Toe game (3x3), and it must played by two people from two different computers. It also needs a third computer to be the server that controls the game state during a match and communicate with both players.

It can be classified as an application in the Application Layer (OSI model), and to implement that, we have used concepts such as sockets, primitive functions e.g. *recv*, and also threads.
