Programming Assignment 1 of the subject Recommender Systems from UFMG.

This programming assignment has the goal to yield a recommender system for movies. For the beginning, either model-based and memory-based approaches will be explored. Concepts like data normalization, similarity computation, neighborhood selection, rating aggregation, and dimensionality reduction will be tested and the best model is going to be selected.
